    <h2>Corruption in the world of Football</h2>
    <p>Wherever money is involved, you can bet that there is also corruption lying about somewhere.
       Unfortunately, this is very true in the world of football and it affects many aspects of the game</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>FIFA WORLD CUP</b> - FIFA is sort of the overseer of any International football events which includes perhaps the most popular sporting even in the world
        the FIFA world cup. Part of organizing the world cup is deciding where it will be held (usually in one county or sometimes countries close together)
        It is the FIFA officials that vote on this themselves but after the 2022 location decision, it was clear that corruption had a big part to do in the decision.
        Out of all the places in the world, Qatar was chosen (weather so hot, the world cup might have to be played in the winter rather than the summer)
        Of course it came to light that some FIFA officials were of course bribed by the very wealthy state of Qatar. 
        </li>
       
        <li><b>MANCHESTER CITY</b> - Manchester City is a Football club that plays in the top tier of British Football. Unlike their rivals Manchester United, Manchester City 
        Did not have a history of success and only started having success after 2008, when billionaire Sheikh Mansour bought the club. Soon after 
        The club began raking in money for better training facilities and more expensive players. Recently however, UEFA (oversees European Football)
        Recently punished the club and imposed serious bans when it was brought to light that the billionaire club owner was illegally flooding the club
        with money that he was disguising as sponsor money. 
        </li>
        <li><b>OTHER MENTIONS</b> - There are many other examples of corruption. The club PSG (Paris Saint-Germain) has gone through a similar situation as Manchester City. The Redbull owned club RB Leipzig is an example of a big corporation such as redbull, using their money in order to compromise the integrity of the game and flood the club with money in order to bring success.
