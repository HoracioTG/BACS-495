            American population in America. Morover, she brings to light that the actions of
            the past (Native American genocide) are still affecting the way Natives live. She then
            mentions how the Natives are resisting and are fighting in hopes of gaining back what 
            they once lost and heal the wounds that were made.</td>

             <td>This video goes over the idea of altruism which is a fancy word for the idea of
            being selfless. It discusses scientific studies in which people were given $10 and then asked if they wanted to share that amount with another person in another room who they would never see. Ultimately, it was found that people usually tended to give away $3. However, when conditions were changed, for example both parties had money and could now steal from the other, then people would not be as inclined to give but rather take. The conclusion was that people in this experiment were not so much selfless, but just wanted to appear as such </td>

             <td>Renata Salecl brings up an interesting view on the idea of choice and how having choices or the ability to choose, can lead to nothing being done at all. At the heart of it, she explains how our choices
                 are pressured by anxiety and the fact that in making a choice, you will always lose something else. These things then lead to nothing being done within society as, given the ability to make ones own
                 choice, leads to nothing being done at all.</td>

             <td>Jeremy Rifkin explores the idea that humans are an Empathetic society. He explains how
                 this is a fact as our brains & neurons react and imitate the emotions that others go
                 through. He says that it is the empathy that ultimately connects us and we have to
                 start having this same mindset.</td>
