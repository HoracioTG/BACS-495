            In your life you will most likely be asked who your role model is at least once.
            For many, this a tough question so they would give multiple answers. 
            For me however, a role model is someone who shows characteristics that I strive to replicate in my life. 
        <p>
            The people I see as role models display the following characteristics.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Self Confident - they have no problem believing and striving to achieve the goals they have set for themselves despite what anyone says</li>
            <li>Artistic - design and create things that have inspired them </li>
            <li>Impactful - everything they has a big impact on the people who look up to them</li>
            <li>Comitted - they work and work on their aspirations regradless of how much it takes </li>
            <li>Successful - despite what barriers they had put up in front of them, they manage to accomplish what they wanted to</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            No other celebrity encapsulates the characteristics above as Kanye West. Ever since his start in the music industry he has been proving people wrong and accomplishing his goals. When he was told he couldn't rap, his first album went platinum. When they criticized his shoe design, he created one of the most successful clothing empires in his Yeezy clothing line. Through his self confidence, Kanye West has achieved every one of his goals.
