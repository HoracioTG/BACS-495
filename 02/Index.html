            When asked who their role models are, people usually have many answers.
            However a true role model is someone that exhibits characteristics which one strives to replicate. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The role model that inspires me displays the following characteristics. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Self belief - they trust in what they do despite what anyone else might say</li>
            <li>Pioneer - carve our their own path </li>
            <li>Impactful - everything they do changes the world</li>
            <li>Creative & Artistic - have the ability create beautiful things</li>
            <li>Determined - hell-bent on achieving their goals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The more I thought it about it, no artist has had more impact on my life than Kanye West. 
            From the moment Kanye's career began, he has been told he couldn't do the things he wanted to do.
            Whether it was rapping, designing clothes or winning awards, Kanye has done everything his heart desired despite what anyone told him.
            Several very successful albums & a successful clothing line later, and Kanye has established his influence on the world.
